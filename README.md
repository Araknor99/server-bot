# server-bot
A Bot I am making to manage a minecraft server via discord. 
This is work in progress!

---

Due to the actually astounding amounts of git clones this project has recieved, I think I should clarify:
### This does not work as of yet!  

THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT CURRENTLY ACHIEVE ANYTHING OF WHAT IS PLANNED.  
DO NOT HOPE TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO USE THIS RIGHT NOW!  

I will change the README.md when the time comes and this is usable.
